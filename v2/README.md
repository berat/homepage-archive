This repository contains the source code for my personal websites, which I decided to open source. Initially, the project was not intended to be open source, so I apologize for any confusion or mess in the codebase! The websites include a bookmarks page powered by Raindrop, a photo gallery page using Unsplash, and article storage with MDX.
