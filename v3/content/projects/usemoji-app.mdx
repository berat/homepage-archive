Here is we are here! It's my first <b className="active-blue">#sideproject</b> and I've been sharing the entire process with <b className="active-blue">#buildinpublic</b>. 

I'm building a product that helps you find the appropriate emoji according to your write by AI.  I'm using **GPT-3** for this project. If you want to follow the entire process you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/beratbozkurt0)

## What is Usemoji.app?

As we all know, emojis have become an integrat part of how we communicate in today's digital age. They add a whole new layer of emojiton and context to our messages. And that's where [usemoji.app](https://usemoji.app) steps in - select your text and find the emoji that fits your lines in seconds. It helps you elevate your texts and increase engagement.


## Tech Stack

- <span className="active-blue">Next.js</span> for Web.
- <span className="active-blue">Shadcn/ui</span> for UI library and <span className="active-blue">Tailwind</span> for styling.
- <span className="active-blue">Supabase</span> for database.
- <span className="active-blue">Vercel</span> for deploy.
- <span className="active-blue">Mailerlite</span> for email marketing.

> The first version will be basic and minimal. I will add new features in the future.
> Just install, click and use it, that's all!


## The Process

1- I design a logo for the product. I'm not a designer but I'm trying to do my best. I use <span className="active-blue">Figma</span>. While I design the logo, in my mind I have emoji colors and AI symbols. I think I did a good job. What do you think? 

<Image alt="" src="/projects/usemoji-app/usemoji-app-logo.svg" width="475" height="163" />

2- I'll work with **AI** first time. So that's why I need to read some documentation about <span className="active-blue">openAI</span> and watch some videos. When everything is okay on my side, I created an api key and try to made some example. 

3- Actually I have a few feature about the product. But as I said I want to launch as a **MVP** because I don't have time so much to finish it. If users wants to use and new features then I'll improve it.

4- Firstly I will launch an *extension on google chrome*. It was easy to build to me. 

<Image alt="" src="/projects/usemoji-app/first-screen.jpeg" width="1400" height="450" />

5- I thought it will be good if I prepare a **waitlist page** on website. I'm sharing about the product on [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/beratbozkurt0) and I want to collect emails. Because It can be hard to reach some users for this product and I don't want to lose them. That's why I guess coolect eamil will be a good idea. 

>I didn't have a hard time unless try to ready an image for project :) 

6- I created profiles and some articles on <i className="active-blue">**ProductHunt, Reddit, HackerNews**</i> to pre-launch. 

Also I'm thinking to beta test with a few people on waiting list. I'll send them an email and ask them to try the product. I'll collect feedbacks and improve the product.

7- Here are some numbers. I only announced it once on Twitter and these are the statistics after that.

- **291 visitors**
- **55 subscriber**
- **54 countries**

8- Actually I'm planing **MVP version** and that's why I want to keep it simple the user flow. I've a few path for it but need to decide which one is better both in terms of user experience and development logic. That's why just 2-3 inputs, 2 buttons, 1 settings menu, 3 tab bar and that's all. If you are new user in this application you will not hard to use it. 

9- Next.js is really a very fast developing update. While I build usemoji they are publish new version and i decided to update my next.js version. I take some time to update it but it's okay. Because i learnt a lot of think for **version 14**. Also I have to prepare some design for product. I don't like this steps but what I can do it... I have to it... 

I added a new feature that is **context menu**. Actually I've been thinking the context menu will be quick way to recive emoji text. Probably I'll often use it. I hope you will like it :)

10- Totally finished extension main page. It takes time a lot but It's okay because I don't have any design file. Sometimes I like to develop something without design, in these time I feel a lot more inspiration coming. Here is a screenshot on extension page.

11- During this time, I have dealt with many **bug fixes**. Well, if you are a developer, this becomes a part of your life :)

12- I had some basic problems. I'm running next.js app as an iframe in Chrome extension. At this point, sending data from the extension to the next.js app was not working very well. I solved it successfully and it's working nicely now.

13- If you have a product you should have **settings page** for account, payment, email marketing... I hate to build these pages. Probably if I need to build a product I will use this design and logic again on the future project. 

I tried to keep simple all logic on the settings page. Because I feel it will be unnecessary if I add more logic and increase to complexity

14- I updated **homepage design** again. Because from now on, we can start accepting users for the beta version. Only the AI part remains. But I can still start developing the homepage. That's why I prepared some visuals and content.

<Tip>
I have prepared an open source project for homepage design that everyone can use, and you can access it from my github account. [github/waitlist-landing-page](https://github.com/berat/waitlist-landing-page)
</Tip>

15- To determine the price of the application, I opened a poll on Twitter and set it at **$4**. Thus, it will be an amount that anyone who wants can use it. 

I also prepared a gif that I liked. I want to share it here too :)

<Image alt="" src="/projects/usemoji-app/hero.gif" width="800" height="600" />

16- This was my first time doing a project with AI, so I read documents and tried a few prompts.

17- For the first time, I shared the output I got from the interface on my Twitter account. This became the first
visual that showed exactly how the application works.

<Image alt="first-screen-usemoji-app" src="/projects/usemoji-app/usemoji-dashboard.jpeg" width="1260" height="800" />

18- After completing the connections with AI, I defined a special discount for email subscribers that they could use 25% cheaper. Thus, I reached my first users.

Keep in touch. Story will continue...
